Soft 252 coursework
Was unable to fix DPI issues with scaling worked fine in my IDE but shows too big when I run the .JAR may be that it just doesnt work on my laptop was unable to test on others
Other than the scaling making it niegh on unusable the program hasnt crashed on latest version and I believe fulfils the spec No UML to support.
